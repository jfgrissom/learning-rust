# Things to remember from the "Programming is a Guessing Game" chapter.

## Managing Rust Compiler Versions

- `rustup` is the command line tool for installing Rust and managing Rust
  versions. Figured this out just using the tool during this chapter's
  exercises.

## Handling Strings

- When using `println!` macro the string `"You guessed: {guess}"` has
  placeholders ({} - the book actually says "like crab claws holding the value
  in place"ðŸ˜Š) that work like a JavaScript/Typescript string literal type
  (example: `` `You guessed: ${guess}` ``).

## Handling Variables

- Variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable, use the `mut`
  keyword.
- There is a feature called shadowing that allows you to redeclare a variable
  with the same name as a previous variable. This is useful when you want to
  change the value of a variable but keep the same name. Particularly useful
  when casting one type to another.

## Handling Comments

- Two forward slashes `//` are used to start a comment that lasts until the end
  of the line.

## Analyzer in Your Editor

- The editor may throw errors requesting that you add a Cargo.toml file when one
  exists. You may need to tell your editor were the TOML files are for your
  projects.

## The Prelude

- The prelude (a module) is a list of items that are imported into your
  application's scope by default (it's available to all of your code).
- Items in the prelude are available without being prefixed with the module
  name.
- The standard library is available to review at
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html

- The `Result` type is an enum that is part of the prelude. It has the
  capability to allow your application to crash by calling the `expect` method.
  If you've reached a logical place to stop the application (such as an level OS
  failure) then you want the application to crash from a result (like a system
  level IO failure).

## Regarding Types (Structures/Structs)

- The book uses calls out an "instance of a type". This is interesting because
  it implies that types are not static. So, for example, a `String` is not the
  same as a `&String`. String is a type (the blueprint) that represents a
  dynamic sequence of characters. `&String` is a reference to an instance of a
  `String` (the literal thing constructed from the blueprint).

- Enums are actually useful in Rust to enforce compile-time checks.

- The `Result` type is an enum that is part of the prelude. It is used to handle
  a result that has the potential to return an error.

## Regarding Packages

- Packages are compiled into Crates.
- Crates are the compiled binary or library.
- Cargo does a lot of work to protect your project from accidental upgrades that
  could break your code.

## Regarding Deprecations

- The rust analyzer will show you deprecations and make recommendations for the
  new way to do things.

## Regarding Enums

- It's clear that this is a powerful feature in Rust. It's "Enums Done
  Correctly".
- The Result type is an enum.
- The Ordering types is an enum.
  - This is interesting because it's a way to handle comparisons using Enums.
  - It handles ordering by using higher order concepts like Less, Greater, and
    Equal.
- The Option type is an enum.
- Variants almost look like options. For example a `Result` type has two
  variants: `Ok` and `Err`. An `Option` type has two variants: `Some` and
  `None`. From the implementors perspective it's a variant but from the
  consumer's perspective it's an option that has to be accounted for.

## Regarding `match`

- `match` is a control flow operator that is used to compare a value to a
  pattern and execute different code based on the value.
- `match` is a powerful control flow operator that is used to handle enums.
- `match` is a control flow operator that is used to handle options.
- There is no switch statement in Rust which is the closest control flow
  operator in other languages.
- `match` provides certain guarantees that other control flow operators do not.
  For example, `match` guarantees that all possible cases are handled.
- Changing from an `expect` to a `match` is a good way to handle errors.
- The `match` operator is actually a good way to handle errors.
